      <br><h2>Here's a time line of Agatha Christie's life</h2>
      <ul id = "tribute-info-points">
        <li><strong>September 15, 1890: Birth of Agatha Christie</strong><br>Agatha Mary Clarissa Miller, aka Agatha Christie, was born on September 15, 1890, in Torquay, England. It was his mother and his sister who put him on the literary stirrup. She is the author of many successful detective novels from which the characters of Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot are derived. Qualified as the Queen of Crime, she is distinguished by the closed-door context she offers readers. Many adaptations of his works on the screen have been produced, such as Murder on the Orient-Express, Ten Little Negroes, and Death on the Nile.
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>December 25, 1914: Agatha Miller marries Archibald Christie</strong><br>At a ball given in 1912, Agatha Miller met the charming Archibald Christie, a lieutenant aviator in the Royal Flying Corps of the British army. The alchemy quickly takes place between the two lovebirds, and as the First World War begins its ravages, the couple marries on Christmas Day in the year 1914. Agatha Miller then takes the name of Agatha Christie. A surname that she adopted as a pen name, and which she kept until her death. The couple gave birth to a little Rosalind on August 5, 1919, the only daughter of the writer.

        <li><strong>December 3, 1926: Agatha Christie disappears for ten days</strong><br>
After her mother's death, Agatha Christie suffered another heartbreak with her unfaithful husband's divorce petition. Unhappy, the queen of detective stories simply disappeared on December 3, 1926. The police found her car, a Morris Cowley, abandoned near a pond in Surrey County. The British media relay the information, hunts are organized... Nothing. She was found twelve days later. It turns out Agatha Christie had been spending the whole time in a hotel in the resort town of Harrogate, under an assumed name. She then claims to remember nothing, and will not speak of this incident again. However, she made fun of the incompetence of the investigators, who did not think to question her daughter Rosalind, who was nevertheless in the secret, her mother not wanting to worry her with this disappearance. A disappearance that would not have been a task in one of Agatha Christie's novels, and which still remains a mystery today, considered by the press as a media stunt.
        </li><br><br>
        <li><strong>January 12, 1976: Death of Agatha Christie</strong><br>The Queen of Crime dies shortly after concluding the adventures of her iconic character Hercule Poirot. She died aged 85 at her home near Oxford.<br><br>
